# TODO — Cycle 3: Variants

- [ ] List known variants per group (e.g., PRISMA-S, PRISMA-ScR; CONSORT extensions) with sources.
- [ ] For each variant, add an entry to `source/index.yml` with:
  - [ ] `level: variant`, `group: <family>`, and `variant_of: <archetype-id>`.
- [ ] Source originals to `source/variants/<name>.<ext>` + metadata.
- [ ] Create `markdown/variants/<name>.md` with clear reference to the parent archetype.
- [ ] Create `typst/variants/<name>.typ` and `latex/variants/<name>.tex`.
- [ ] Validate Markdown and cross-links; ensure numbering aligns with the variant’s official structure.
- [ ] Update `source/index.yml` status and file paths.
