# TODO â€” Phase 2: Source and Store Originals

- [ ] For each index entry, download the preferred original to `source/` using kebab-case names.
- [ ] Add sidecar metadata `source/<name>.yml` including: `source_url`, `retrieved_at`, `checksum`, `license`, `notes`.
- [ ] Verify checksums and file integrity for each asset.
- [ ] Normalize filenames and ensure uniqueness across the repository.
- [ ] Update `source/index.yml` with file paths and checksums.
- [ ] Spot-check 3 entries for accuracy and provenance completeness.
