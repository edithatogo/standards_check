# TODO â€” Phase 1: Map Equator Network Checklists

- [ ] Define scope (e.g., CONSORT, PRISMA, STROBE, CARE, ARRIVE, CHEERS, TRIPOD).
- [ ] Create index schema (`source/index.yml`):
  - [ ] `id` (kebab-case), `title`, `url`, `version`, `date`, `license`, `publisher`, `notes`.
- [ ] Collect official URLs from equator-network.org (or affiliated sites) and record versions.
- [ ] Record licensing/usage terms per checklist (redistribution allowed?).
- [ ] Capture alternates (PDF/HTML/DOCX) and preferred format.
- [ ] Save a starter `source/index.yml` with at least 5 entries.
- [ ] Review scope and completeness; mark gaps for later expansion.
