## Missing Data

- [ ] **11.1. Handling:** Describe any steps taken to deal with missing data during analysis (e.g. imputation, complete case, subset analysis).

## Meta-analytic Model Description

- [ ] **12.1. Models:** Describe the models used for synthesis of effect sizes.
- [ ] **12.2. Justification:** The most common approach in ecology and evolution will be a random-effects model, often with a hierarchical/multilevel structure. If other types of models are chosen (e.g. common/fixed effects model, unweighted model), provide justification for this choice.

- [ ] **16.2. Investigation:** Describe any steps taken to investigate the effects of such biases (if present).
- [ ] **16.3. Robustness:** Describe any other analyses of robustness of the results, e.g. due to effect size choice, weighting or analytical model assumptions, inclusion or exclusion of subsets of the data, or the inclusion of alternative moderator variables in meta-regressions.
