## Missing Data

- [ ] **11.1** Describe any steps taken to deal with missing data during analysis (e.g. imputation, complete case, subset analysis).
- [ ] **11.2** Justify the decisions made to deal with missing data.

## Meta-analytic Model Description

- [ ] **12.1** Describe the models used for synthesis of effect sizes.
- [ ] **12.2** The most common approach in ecology and evolution will be a random-effects model, often with a hierarchical/multilevel structure. If other types of models are chosen (e.g. common/fixed effects model, unweighted model), provide justification for this choice.
