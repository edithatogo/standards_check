# PRISMA-P Checklist

> Scope: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols.
>
> Reference: See `source/variants/prisma-p.yml` for canonical link and provenance.

## Instructions
- Use the boxes to confirm each reporting item.
- Add reviewer notes under each section as needed.

## Title

- [ ] **1a. Title:** Identification of the report as a protocol of a systematic review.
- [ ] **1b. Update:** If the protocol is for an update of an existing review, identify as such.

## Abstract

- [ ] **2. Abstract:** Provide a structured summary of the protocol, including:
    - **Background:** Rationale for the review.
    - **Methods:** Key elements of the methods, including eligibility criteria, information sources, risk of bias assessment, and data synthesis.
    - **Registration:** If registered, provide the registration number and registry name.

## Introduction

- [ ] **3. Rationale:** Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- [ ] **4. Objectives:** Provide an explicit statement of the question(s) the review will address with reference to participants, interventions, comparators, and outcomes (PICO).

## Methods

- [ ] **5. Eligibility criteria:** Specify the study characteristics (e.g., PICO, study design, setting, time frame) and report characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) to be used as criteria for eligibility for the review.
- [ ] **6. Information sources:** Describe all intended information sources (e.g., electronic databases, contact with study authors, trial registers, or other grey literature sources) with planned dates of coverage.
- [ ] **7. Search strategy:** Present a draft of the search strategy to be used for at least one electronic database, including planned limits, such that it could be repeated.
- [ ] **8. Study records: data management:** Describe the mechanism(s) that will be used to manage records and data throughout the review.
- [ ] **9. Study records: selection process:** State the process that will be used for selecting studies (e.g., two independent reviewers) for inclusion in the review.
- [ ] **10. Study records: data collection process:** Describe the process of data extraction, including how it will be done and who will do it.
- [ ] **11a. Data items:** List and define all variables for which data will be sought, including PICO and other relevant data for the review.
- [ ] **11b. Outcomes and prioritization:** List and define all outcomes for which data will be sought. If more than one, prioritize and explain the choice of the main outcomes.
- [ ] **12. Risk of bias in individual studies:** Describe the planned method for assessing risk of bias in individual studies, including how it will be used in data synthesis.
- [ ] **13. Data synthesis:** Describe the planned methods of data synthesis, including a description of the summary measures and any planned investigation of heterogeneity.
- [ ] **14. Meta-bias(es):** Describe any planned assessment of meta-bias(es) (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting within studies).
- [ ] **15. Confidence in cumulative evidence:** Describe how the strength of the body of evidence will be assessed.

## Other

- [ ] **16. Amendments:** Describe any planned amendments to the protocol.
- [ ] **17. Dissemination:** Describe the planned dissemination strategy.
