## Instructions
- Use the boxes to confirm each reporting item.
- Add reviewer notes under each section as needed.

## Title or Abstract
- [ ] **1. Identification:** Identification as a study of diagnostic accuracy using at least one measure of accuracy (such as sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, or AUC).

## Abstract
- [ ] **2. Structured summary:** Structured summary of study design, methods, results, and conclusions (for specific guidance, see STARD for Abstracts).

## Introduction
- [ ] **3. Scientific and clinical background:** Scientific and clinical background, including the intended use and clinical role of the index test.
- [ ] **4. Study objectives and hypotheses:** Study objectives and hypotheses.

## Methods
- [ ] **5. Study design:** Whether data collection was planned before the index test and reference standard were performed (prospective study) or after (retrospective study).
- [ ] **6. Participants:** Eligibility criteria.
- [ ] **7. Participants:** On what basis potentially eligible participants were identified (such as symptoms, results from previous tests, inclusion in registry).
- [ ] **8. Participants:** Where and when potentially eligible participants were identified (setting, location and dates).
- [ ] **9. Participants:** Whether participants formed a consecutive, random or convenience series.
- [ ] **10a. Test methods:** Index test, in sufficient detail to allow replication.
- [ ] **10b. Test methods:** Reference standard, in sufficient detail to allow replication.
- [ ] **11. Test methods:** Rationale for choosing the reference standard (if alternatives exist).
- [ ] **12a. Test methods:** Definition of and rationale for test positivity cut-offs or result categories of the index test, distinguishing prespecified from exploratory.
- [ ] **12b. Test methods:** Definition of and rationale for test positivity cut-offs or result categories of the reference standard, distinguishing prespecified from exploratory.
- [ ] **13a. Test methods:** Whether clinical information and reference standard results were available to the performers/readers of the index test.
- [ ] **13b. Test methods:** Whether clinical information and index test results were available to the assessors of the reference standard.
- [ ] **14. Analysis:** Methods for estimating or comparing measures of diagnostic accuracy.
- [ ] **15. Analysis:** How indeterminate index test or reference standard results were handled.
- [ ] **16. Analysis:** How missing data on the index test and reference standard were handled.
- [ ] **17. Analysis:** Any analyses of variability in diagnostic accuracy, distinguishing prespecified from exploratory.
- [ ] **18. Analysis:** Sample size calculation.

## Results
- [ ] **19. Participants:** Flow of participants, using a diagram.
- [ ] **20. Participants:** Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of participants.
- [ ] **21. Participants:** Distribution of severity of disease in those with the target condition; other diagnoses in participants without the target condition.
- [ ] **22. Test results:** Time interval from index test to reference standard, and any treatment administered between them.
- [ ] **23. Test results:** Cross tabulation of the index test results (or their distribution) by the results of the reference standard; for continuous results, the distribution of the test results by the results of the reference standard.
- [ ] **24. Test results:** Any adverse events from performing the index test or the reference standard.
- [ ] **25. Estimates:** Estimates of diagnostic accuracy and their precision (such as 95% confidence intervals).
- [ ] **26. Estimates:** Any analyses of variability, including subgroup analyses.
- [ ] **27. Estimates:** The number of indeterminate test results or missing data and where they occurred.

## Discussion
- [ ] **28. Study limitations:** Study limitations, including sources of potential bias, statistical uncertainty, and generalisability.
- [ ] **29. Implications for practice:** Implications for practice, including the intended use and clinical role of the index test.

## Other Information
- [ ] **30. Registration number and name of registry:** Registration number and name of registry.
- [ ] **31. Where the full study protocol can be accessed:** Where the full study protocol can be accessed.
- [ ] **32. Funding:** Sources of funding and other support; role of funders.
