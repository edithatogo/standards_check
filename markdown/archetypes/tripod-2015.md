## Instructions
- Use task list items for checklist boxes; these become interactive checkboxes in PDF.
- Use a span with class `.textfield` for freeâ€‘text fields.

## Title and Abstract

- [ ] **1. Title:** Identify the study as one that develops, validates, or updates a multivariable prediction model, specify the target population, and the outcome to be predicted.
- [ ] **2. Abstract:** Provide a summary of the objectives, study design, setting, participants, sample size, predictors, outcome, statistical analysis, results, and conclusions.

## Introduction

- [ ] **3. Background and Objectives:** Explain the medical context and rationale for the study, including references to existing models.

## Methods

- [ ] **4. Source of data:** Describe the study design and key elements of the study setting.
- [ ] **5. Participants:** Describe the eligibility criteria for participants.
- [ ] **6. Outcome:** Clearly define the outcome that is predicted by the model, including how and when it was assessed.
- [ ] **7. Predictors:** Clearly define all predictors used in the model, including how and when they were measured.
- [ ] **8. Sample size:** Explain how the study size was determined.
- [ ] **9. Missing data:** Describe how missing data were handled.
- [ ] **10. Statistical analysis methods:** Describe how predictors were handled in the analyses.
- [ ] **11. Model development:** Specify the type of model, all model-building procedures, and the method for internal validation.
- [ ] **12. Model performance:** Specify all measures used to assess model performance and, if relevant, to compare multiple models.

## Results

- [ ] **13. Participants:** Describe the flow of participants through the study.
- [ ] **14. Model development:** Specify the number of participants and outcome events in each analysis.
- [ ] **15. Model specification:** Present the full prediction model for use by others.
- [ ] **16. Model performance:** Report performance measures for the prediction model.
- [ ] **17. Model validation:** For validation, describe how the predictions were calculated and report the results.

## Discussion

- [ ] **18. Limitations:** Discuss any limitations of the study.
- [ ] **19. Interpretation:** Give an overall interpretation of the results, considering objectives, limitations, and other relevant evidence.
- [ ] **20. Implications:** Discuss the implications for practice and research.

## Other Information

- [ ] **21. Supplementary information:** Provide information about the availability of supplementary resources.
- [ ] **22. Funding:** Disclose the source of funding and the role of the funders.
