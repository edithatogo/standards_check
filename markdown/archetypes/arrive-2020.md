# ARRIVE 2.0 Checklist

> Scope: The ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines are a comprehensive checklist for reporting animal research. These guidelines are designed to improve the transparency and quality of scientific publications.
>
> Reference: See `source/archetypes/arrive-2020.yml` for canonical link and provenance.

## Instructions
- Use task list items for checklist boxes; these become interactive checkboxes in PDF.
- Use a span with class `.textfield` for freeâ€‘text fields.

## The ARRIVE Essential 10

- [ ] **Study Design:** A brief description of the study design for each experiment, including the groups being compared (with control groups) and the experimental unit (e.g., a single animal or a cage of animals).
- [ ] **Sample Size:** The exact number of experimental units in each group and the total number for each experiment, along with the total number of animals used. The method for determining the sample size should also be explained.
- [ ] **Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:** A description of the criteria for including or excluding animals or data points during the experiment and analysis.
- [ ] **Randomization:** A statement on whether randomization was used to assign experimental units to groups and a description of the method used.
- [ ] **Blinding:** A description of who was blinded during the different stages of the experiment (e.g., during allocation, outcome assessment, and data analysis).
- [ ] **Outcome Measures:** A clear definition of all assessed outcome measures. For studies testing a hypothesis, the primary outcome measure should be specified.
- [ ] **Statistical Methods:** Detailed information about the statistical methods used for each analysis, including the software used.
- [ ] **Experimental Animals:** Species-appropriate details of the animals used, such as species, strain, sex, and age.
- [ ] **Experimental Procedures:** A thorough description of the procedures for each experimental group, detailed enough for replication by others.
- [ ] **Results:** For each experiment, a report of summary and descriptive statistics for each group, including a measure of variability.

## The Recommended Set

- [ ] **Abstract:** A summary of the study's background, objectives, methods, principal findings, and conclusions.
- [ ] **Background:** An explanation of the scientific context and the experimental approach.
- [ ] **Objectives:** A clear statement of the research objectives and any specific hypotheses being tested.
- [ ] **Ethical Statement:** The name of the ethical review committee that approved the study and any relevant license or protocol numbers.
- [ ] **Housing and Husbandry:** Details of the housing and husbandry conditions for the animals.
- [ ] **Animal Care and Monitoring:** A description of any interventions to reduce pain and suffering, as well as any adverse events and humane endpoints.
- [ ] **Interpretation/Scientific Implications:** An interpretation of the results in the context of the study's objectives and existing literature.
- [ ] **Generalizability/Translation:** A discussion of the generalizability of the findings.
- [ ] **Protocol Registration:** A statement indicating if a protocol was prepared before the study and where it was registered.
- [ ] **Data Access:** A statement on where the study data can be accessed.
- [ ] **Declaration of Interest:** A declaration of any potential conflicts of interest.
- [ ] **Funding:** Information on all funding sources and the role of the funder(s).
