## Instructions
- Use the boxes to confirm each reporting item.
- Add reviewer notes under each section as needed.

## Title and abstract

- [ ] **1. Title and abstract:** Indicate the study’s design with a commonly used term in the title or the abstract.

## Introduction

- [ ] **2. Background/rationale:** Explain the scientific background and rationale for the investigation being reported.
- [ ] **3. Objectives:** State specific objectives, including any prespecified hypotheses.

## Methods

- [ ] **4. Study design:** Present key elements of study design early in the paper.
- [ ] **5. Setting:** Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection.
- [ ] **6. Participants:** Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of selection of participants.
- [ ] **7. Variables:** Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers. Give diagnostic criteria, if applicable.
- [ ] **8. Data sources/ measurement:** For each variable of interest, give sources of data and details of methods of assessment (measurement).
- [ ] **9. Bias:** Describe any efforts to address potential sources of bias.
- [ ] **10. Study size:** Explain how the study size was arrived at.
- [ ] **11. Quantitative variables:** Explain how quantitative variables were handled in the analyses. If applicable, describe which groupings were chosen and why.
- [ ] **12. Statistical methods:** Describe all statistical methods, including those used to control for confounding.

## Results

- [ ] **13. Participants:** Report numbers of individuals at each stage of study—eg, numbers potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible, included in the study, completing follow-up, and analysed.
- [ ] **14. Descriptive data:** Give characteristics of study participants (eg, demographic, clinical, social) and information on exposures and potential confounders.
- [ ] **15. Outcome data:** Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures over time.
- [ ] **16. Main results:** Give unadjusted estimates and, if applicable, confounder-adjusted estimates and their precision (eg, 95% confidence interval). Make clear which confounders were adjusted for and why they were included.
- [ ] **17. Other analyses:** Report other analyses done—eg, analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses.

## Discussion

- [ ] **18. Key results:** Summarise key results with reference to study objectives.
- [ ] **19. Limitations:** Discuss limitations of the study, taking into account sources of potential bias or imprecision. Discuss both direction and magnitude of any potential bias.
- [ ] **20. Interpretation:** Give a cautious overall interpretation of results considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity of analyses, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence.
- [ ] **21. Generalisability:** Discuss the generalisability (external validity) of the study results.

## Other information

- [ ] **22. Funding:** Give the source of funding and the role of the funders for the present study and, if applicable, for the original study on which the present article is based.
