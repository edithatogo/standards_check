== Instructions
<instructions>
- Use the boxes to confirm each reporting item.
- Add reviewer notes under each section as needed.

== Title and Abstract
<title-and-abstract>
- ☐ #strong[1a. Title:] Identification of the trial as randomised.
- ☐ #strong[1b. Abstract:] Structured summary of trial design, methods,
  results, and conclusions.

== Introduction
<introduction>
- ☐ #strong[2a. Background:] Scientific background and explanation of
  rationale.
- ☐ #strong[2b. Objectives:] Specific objectives or hypotheses.

== Methods
<methods>
- ☐ #strong[3a. Trial design:] Description of trial design (e.g.,
  parallel, factorial) including allocation ratio.
- ☐ #strong[3b. Changes to trial design:] Important changes to methods
  after trial commencement (such as eligibility criteria), with reasons.
- ☐ #strong[4a. Participants:] Eligibility criteria for participants.
- ☐ #strong[4b. Study settings:] Settings and locations where the data
  were collected.
- ☐ #strong[\5. Interventions:] The interventions for each group with
  sufficient details to allow replication, including how and when they
  were actually administered.
- ☐ #strong[6a. Outcomes:] Completely defined pre-specified primary and
  secondary outcome measures, including how and when they were assessed.
- ☐ #strong[6b. Changes to outcomes:] Any changes to trial outcomes
  after the trial commenced, with reasons.
- ☐ #strong[7a. Sample size:] How sample size was determined.
- ☐ #strong[7b. Interim analyses and stopping guidelines:] When
  applicable, explanation of any interim analyses and stopping
  guidelines.
- ☐ #strong[8a. Randomisation: sequence generation:] Method used to
  generate the random allocation sequence.
- ☐ #strong[8b. Randomisation: type:] Type of randomisation; details of
  any restriction (e.g., blocking and block size).
- ☐ #strong[\9. Allocation concealment mechanism:] Mechanism used to
  implement the random allocation sequence (e.g., sequentially numbered
  containers), describing any steps taken to conceal the sequence until
  interventions were assigned.
- ☐ #strong[\10. Implementation:] Who generated the random allocation
  sequence, who enrolled participants, and who assigned participants to
  interventions.
- ☐ #strong[11a. Blinding:] If done, who was blinded after assignment to
  interventions (e.g., participants, care providers, those assessing
  outcomes) and how.
- ☐ #strong[11b. Similarity of interventions:] If relevant, description
  of the similarity of interventions.
- ☐ #strong[12a. Statistical methods:] Statistical methods used to
  compare groups for primary and secondary outcomes.
- ☐ #strong[12b. Additional analyses:] Methods for additional analyses,
  such as subgroup analyses and adjusted analyses.

== Results
<results>
- ☐ #strong[13a. Participant flow (a diagram is strongly recommended):]
  For each group, the numbers of participants who were randomly
  assigned, received intended treatment, and were analysed for the
  primary outcome.
- ☐ #strong[13b. Losses and exclusions:] For each group, losses and
  exclusions after randomisation, together with reasons.
- ☐ #strong[14a. Recruitment:] Dates defining the periods of recruitment
  and follow-up.
- ☐ #strong[14b. Reason for stopping:] Why the trial ended or was
  stopped.
- ☐ #strong[\15. Baseline data:] A table showing baseline demographic
  and clinical characteristics for each group.
- ☐ #strong[\16. Numbers analysed:] For each group, number of
  participants (denominator) included in each analysis and whether the
  analysis was by original assigned groups.
- ☐ #strong[17a. Outcomes and estimation:] For each primary and
  secondary outcome, results for each group, and the estimated effect
  size and its precision (such as 95% confidence interval).
- ☐ #strong[17b. Binary outcomes:] For binary outcomes, presentation of
  both absolute and relative effect sizes is recommended.
- ☐ #strong[\18. Ancillary analyses:] Results of any other analyses
  performed, including subgroup analyses and adjusted analyses,
  distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory.
- ☐ #strong[\19. Harms:] All important harms or unintended effects in
  each group.

== Discussion
<discussion>
- ☐ #strong[\20. Limitations:] Trial limitations, addressing sources of
  potential bias, imprecision, and, if relevant, multiplicity of
  analyses.
- ☐ #strong[\21. Generalisability:] Generalisability (external validity,
  applicability) of the trial findings.
- ☐ #strong[\22. Interpretation:] Interpretation consistent with
  results, balancing benefits and harms, and considering other relevant
  evidence.

== Other Information
<other-information>
- ☐ #strong[\23. Registration:] Registration number and name of trial
  registry.
- ☐ #strong[\24. Protocol:] Where the full trial protocol can be
  accessed, if available.
- ☐ #strong[\25. Funding:] Sources of funding and other support (such as
  supply of drugs), role of funders.
