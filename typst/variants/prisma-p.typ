== Instructions
<instructions>
- Use the boxes to confirm each reporting item.
- Add reviewer notes under each section as needed.

== Title
<title>
- ☐ #strong[1a. Title:] Identification of the report as a protocol of a
  systematic review.
- ☐ #strong[1b. Update:] If the protocol is for an update of an existing
  review, identify as such.

== Abstract
<abstract>
- ☐ #strong[\2. Abstract:] Provide a structured summary of the protocol,
  including:
  - #strong[Background:] Rationale for the review.
  - #strong[Methods:] Key elements of the methods, including eligibility
    criteria, information sources, risk of bias assessment, and data
    synthesis.
  - #strong[Registration:] If registered, provide the registration
    number and registry name.

== Introduction
<introduction>
- ☐ #strong[\3. Rationale:] Describe the rationale for the review in the
  context of what is already known.
- ☐ #strong[\4. Objectives:] Provide an explicit statement of the
  question(s) the review will address with reference to participants,
  interventions, comparators, and outcomes (PICO).

== Methods
<methods>
- ☐ #strong[\5. Eligibility criteria:] Specify the study characteristics
  (e.g., PICO, study design, setting, time frame) and report
  characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status)
  to be used as criteria for eligibility for the review.
- ☐ #strong[\6. Information sources:] Describe all intended information
  sources (e.g., electronic databases, contact with study authors, trial
  registers, or other grey literature sources) with planned dates of
  coverage.
- ☐ #strong[\7. Search strategy:] Present a draft of the search strategy
  to be used for at least one electronic database, including planned
  limits, such that it could be repeated.
- ☐ #strong[\8. Study records: data management:] Describe the
  mechanism(s) that will be used to manage records and data throughout
  the review.
- ☐ #strong[\9. Study records: selection process:] State the process
  that will be used for selecting studies (e.g., two independent
  reviewers) for inclusion in the review.
- ☐ #strong[\10. Study records: data collection process:] Describe the
  process of data extraction, including how it will be done and who will
  do it.
- ☐ #strong[11a. Data items:] List and define all variables for which
  data will be sought, including PICO and other relevant data for the
  review.
- ☐ #strong[11b. Outcomes and prioritization:] List and define all
  outcomes for which data will be sought. If more than one, prioritize
  and explain the choice of the main outcomes.
- ☐ #strong[\12. Risk of bias in individual studies:] Describe the
  planned method for assessing risk of bias in individual studies,
  including how it will be used in data synthesis.
- ☐ #strong[\13. Data synthesis:] Describe the planned methods of data
  synthesis, including a description of the summary measures and any
  planned investigation of heterogeneity.
- ☐ #strong[\14. Meta-bias(es):] Describe any planned assessment of
  meta-bias(es) (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting within
  studies).
- ☐ #strong[\15. Confidence in cumulative evidence:] Describe how the
  strength of the body of evidence will be assessed.

== Other
<other>
- ☐ #strong[\16. Amendments:] Describe any planned amendments to the
