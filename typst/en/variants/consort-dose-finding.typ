    eligibility criteria), with reasons
  - ☐ 4a. Eligibility criteria for participants
  - ☐ 4b. Settings and locations where the data were collected
  - ☐ 5. The interventions for each group with sufficient details to
    allow replication, including how and when they were actually
    administered
  - ☐ 6a. Completely defined pre-specified primary and secondary outcome
    measures, including how and when they were assessed
  - ☐ 6b. Any changes to trial outcomes after the trial commenced, with
    reasons
  - ☐ 7a. How sample size was determined
  - ☐ 7b. When applicable, explanation of any interim analyses and
    stopping guidelines
  - ☐ 8a. Method used to generate the random allocation sequence
  - ☐ 8b. Type of randomisation; details of any restriction (e.g.,
    blocking and block size)
  - ☐ 9. Mechanism used to implement the random allocation sequence
    (e.g., central telephone; web-based), describing any steps taken to
    conceal the sequence until interventions were assigned
  - ☐ 10. Who generated the random allocation sequence, who enrolled
    participants, and who assigned participants to interventions
  - ☐ 11a. If done, who was blinded after assignment to interventions
    (e.g., participants, care providers, those assessing outcomes) and
    how
  - ☐ 11b. If relevant, description of the similarity of interventions
  - ☐ 12a. Statistical methods used to compare groups for primary and
    secondary outcomes
  - ☐ 12b. Methods for additional analyses, such as subgroup analyses
    and adjusted analyses
- ☐ #strong[Results]
  - ☐ 13a. For each group, the numbers of participants who were randomly
    assigned, received intended treatment, and were analysed for the
    primary outcome
  - ☐ 13b. For each group, losses and exclusions after randomisation,
    together with reasons
  - ☐ 14a. Dates defining the periods of recruitment and follow-up
  - ☐ 14b. Why the trial ended or was stopped
  - ☐ 15. A table showing baseline demographic and clinical
    characteristics for each group
  - ☐ 16. For each group, number of participants (denominator) included
    in each analysis and whether the analysis was by original assigned
    groups
  - ☐ 17a. For each primary and secondary outcome, results for each
    group, and the estimated effect size and its precision (e.g., 95%
    confidence interval)
  - ☐ 17b. For binary outcomes, presentation of both absolute and
    relative effect sizes is recommended
  - ☐ 18. Results of any other analyses performed, including subgroup
    analyses and adjusted analyses, distinguishing pre-specified from
    exploratory
  - ☐ 19. All important harms or unintended effects in each group
- ☐ #strong[Discussion]
  - ☐ 20. Trial limitations, addressing sources of potential bias,
    imprecision, and, if relevant, multiplicity of analyses
  - ☐ 21. Generalisability (external validity, applicability) of the
    trial findings
  - ☐ 22. Interpretation consistent with results, balancing benefits and
    harms, and considering other relevant evidence
- ☐ #strong[Other information]
  - ☐ 23. Registration number and name of trial registry
  - ☐ 24. Where the full trial protocol can be accessed, if available
  - ☐ 25. Sources of funding and other support (e.g., supply of drugs),
    role of funders
