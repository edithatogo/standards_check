== Instructions
<instructions>
- Use the boxes to confirm each reporting item.
- Add reviewer notes under each section as needed.

== Title and abstract
<title-and-abstract>
- ☐ #strong[\1. Title and abstract:] Indicate the study's design with a
  commonly used term in the title or the abstract.

== Introduction
<introduction>
- ☐ #strong[\2. Background/rationale:] Explain the scientific background
  and rationale for the investigation being reported.
- ☐ #strong[\3. Objectives:] State specific objectives, including any
  prespecified hypotheses.

== Methods
<methods>
- ☐ #strong[\4. Study design:] Present key elements of study design
  early in the paper.
- ☐ #strong[\5. Setting:] Describe the setting, locations, and relevant
  dates, including periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data
  collection.
- ☐ #strong[\6. Participants:] Give the eligibility criteria, and the
  sources and methods of selection of participants.
- ☐ #strong[\7. Variables:] Clearly define all outcomes, exposures,
  predictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers. Give
  diagnostic criteria, if applicable.
- ☐ #strong[\8. Data sources/ measurement:] For each variable of
  interest, give sources of data and details of methods of assessment
  (measurement).
- ☐ #strong[\9. Bias:] Describe any efforts to address potential sources
  of bias.
- ☐ #strong[\10. Study size:] Explain how the study size was arrived at.
- ☐ #strong[\11. Quantitative variables:] Explain how quantitative
  variables were handled in the analyses. If applicable, describe which
  groupings were chosen and why.
- ☐ #strong[\12. Statistical methods:] Describe all statistical methods,
  including those used to control for confounding.

== Results
<results>
- ☐ #strong[\13. Participants:] Report numbers of individuals at each
  stage of study---eg, numbers potentially eligible, examined for
  eligibility, confirmed eligible, included in the study, completing
  follow-up, and analysed.
- ☐ #strong[\14. Descriptive data:] Give characteristics of study
  participants (eg, demographic, clinical, social) and information on
  exposures and potential confounders.
- ☐ #strong[\15. Outcome data:] Report numbers of outcome events or
  summary measures over time.
- ☐ #strong[\16. Main results:] Give unadjusted estimates and, if
  applicable, confounder-adjusted estimates and their precision (eg, 95%
  confidence interval). Make clear which confounders were adjusted for
  and why they were included.
- ☐ #strong[\17. Other analyses:] Report other analyses done---eg,
  analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses.

== Discussion
<discussion>
- ☐ #strong[\18. Key results:] Summarise key results with reference to
  study objectives.
- ☐ #strong[\19. Limitations:] Discuss limitations of the study, taking
  into account sources of potential bias or imprecision. Discuss both
  direction and magnitude of any potential bias.
- ☐ #strong[\20. Interpretation:] Give a cautious overall interpretation
  of results considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity of
  analyses, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence.
- ☐ #strong[\21. Generalisability:] Discuss the generalisability
  (external validity) of the study results.

== Other information
<other-information>
- ☐ #strong[\22. Funding:] Give the source of funding and the role of
  the funders for the present study and, if applicable, for the original
  study on which the present article is based.
