== Instructions
<instructions>
- Use the boxes to confirm each reporting item.
- Add reviewer notes under each section as needed.

== Title
<title>
- ☐ #strong[\1. Title:] Identify the report as a systematic review.

== Abstract
<abstract>
- ☐ #strong[\2. Abstract:] See the PRISMA 2020 for Abstracts checklist.

== Introduction
<introduction>
- ☐ #strong[\3. Rationale:] Describe the rationale for the review in the
  context of existing knowledge.
- ☐ #strong[\4. Objectives:] Provide an explicit statement of the main
  objective(s) or question(s) the review addresses.

== Methods
<methods>
- ☐ #strong[\5. Eligibility criteria:] Specify the inclusion and
  exclusion criteria for the review and how studies were grouped for the
  syntheses.
- ☐ #strong[\6. Information sources:] Specify all databases, registers,
  websites, organisations, reference lists and other sources searched or
  consulted to identify studies. Specify the date when each source was
  last searched or consulted.
- ☐ #strong[\7. Search strategy:] Present the full search strategies for
  all databases, registers, and websites, including any filters and
  limits used.
- ☐ #strong[\8. Selection process:] Specify the methods used to decide
  whether a study met the inclusion criteria of the review, including
  how many reviewers screened each record and each report retrieved,
  whether they worked independently, and if applicable, details of
  automation tools used in the process.
- ☐ #strong[\9. Data collection process:] Specify the methods used to
  collect data from reports, including how many reviewers collected data
  from each report, whether they worked independently, any processes for
  obtaining or confirming data from study investigators, and if
  applicable, details of automation tools used in the process.
- ☐ #strong[\10. Data items:] List and define all outcomes for which
  data were sought. Specify whether and how results were sought for each
  outcome, by who, and how they were categorised.
- ☐ #strong[\11. Study risk of bias assessment:] Specify the methods
  used to assess risk of bias in the included studies, including details
  of the tool(s) used, how many reviewers assessed each study and
  whether they worked independently, and if applicable, details of
  automation tools used in the process.
- ☐ #strong[\12. Effect measures:] Specify the effect measure(s) (e.g.,
  risk ratio, mean difference) used in the synthesis or presentation of
  results for each outcome.
- ☐ #strong[\13. Synthesis methods:] Describe the processes used to
  decide which studies were eligible for each synthesis (e.g.,
  tabulating the study intervention characteristics and comparing them
  against the planned groups for each synthesis (item 5)).
- ☐ #strong[\14. Reporting bias assessment:] Describe any methods used
  to assess the risk of bias due to missing results in a synthesis
  (arising from reporting biases).
- ☐ #strong[\15. Certainty assessment:] Describe any methods used to
  assess certainty (or confidence) in the body of evidence for an
  outcome.

== Results
<results>
- ☐ #strong[\16. Study selection:] Describe the results of the search
  and selection process, from the number of records identified in the
  search to the number of studies included in the review, ideally using
  a flow diagram.
- ☐ #strong[\17. Study characteristics:] Cite each included study and
  present its characteristics.
- ☐ #strong[\18. Risk of bias in studies:] Present assessments of risk
  of bias for each included study.
- ☐ #strong[\19. Results of individual studies:] For all outcomes,
  present, for each study: (a) summary statistics for each group (where
  appropriate) and (b) an effect estimate and its precision (e.g.,
  confidence/credible interval), ideally using structured tables or
  plots.
- ☐ #strong[\20. Results of syntheses:] For each synthesis, present
  results for all outcomes that were assessed, and for each outcome,
  present a summary of findings and, if meta-analysis was done, an
  effect estimate and its precision.
- ☐ #strong[\21. Reporting biases:] Present assessments of risk of bias
  due to missing results (arising from reporting biases) for each
  synthesis assessed.
- ☐ #strong[\22. Certainty of evidence:] Present assessments of
  certainty (or confidence) in the body of evidence for each outcome
  assessed.

== Discussion
<discussion>
- ☐ #strong[\23. Discussion:] (a) Provide a general interpretation of
  the results in the context of other evidence. (b) Discuss any
  limitations of the evidence included in the review. (c) Discuss any
  limitations of the review processes used. (d) Discuss the implications
  of the results for practice, policy, and future research.

== Other Information
<other-information>
- ☐ #strong[\24. Registration and protocol:] Provide registration
  information for the review, including register name and registration
  number, or state that the review was not registered.
- ☐ #strong[\25. Support:] Specify the sources of financial or
  non-financial support for the review, and the role of the funders or
  sponsors in the review.
- ☐ #strong[\26. Competing interests:] Declare any competing interests
  of review authors.
- ☐ #strong[\27. Availability of data, code and other materials:] Report
  which of the following are publicly available and where they can be
  found: template data collection forms; data extracted from included
  studies; data used for all analyses; analytic code; any other
  materials used in the review.
