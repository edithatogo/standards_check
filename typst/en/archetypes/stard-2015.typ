== Instructions
<instructions>
- Use the boxes to confirm each reporting item.
- Add reviewer notes under each section as needed.

== Title or Abstract
<title-or-abstract>
- ☐ #strong[\1. Identification:] Identification as a study of diagnostic
  accuracy using at least one measure of accuracy (such as sensitivity,
  specificity, predictive values, or AUC).

== Abstract
<abstract>
- ☐ #strong[\2. Structured summary:] Structured summary of study design,
  methods, results, and conclusions (for specific guidance, see STARD
  for Abstracts).

== Introduction
<introduction>
- ☐ #strong[\3. Scientific and clinical background:] Scientific and
  clinical background, including the intended use and clinical role of
  the index test.
- ☐ #strong[\4. Study objectives and hypotheses:] Study objectives and
  hypotheses.

== Methods
<methods>
- ☐ #strong[\5. Study design:] Whether data collection was planned
  before the index test and reference standard were performed
  (prospective study) or after (retrospective study).
- ☐ #strong[\6. Participants:] Eligibility criteria.
- ☐ #strong[\7. Participants:] On what basis potentially eligible
  participants were identified (such as symptoms, results from previous
  tests, inclusion in registry).
- ☐ #strong[\8. Participants:] Where and when potentially eligible
  participants were identified (setting, location and dates).
- ☐ #strong[\9. Participants:] Whether participants formed a
  consecutive, random or convenience series.
- ☐ #strong[10a. Test methods:] Index test, in sufficient detail to
  allow replication.
- ☐ #strong[10b. Test methods:] Reference standard, in sufficient detail
  to allow replication.
- ☐ #strong[\11. Test methods:] Rationale for choosing the reference
  standard (if alternatives exist).
- ☐ #strong[12a. Test methods:] Definition of and rationale for test
  positivity cut-offs or result categories of the index test,
  distinguishing prespecified from exploratory.
- ☐ #strong[12b. Test methods:] Definition of and rationale for test
  positivity cut-offs or result categories of the reference standard,
  distinguishing prespecified from exploratory.
- ☐ #strong[13a. Test methods:] Whether clinical information and
  reference standard results were available to the performers/readers of
  the index test.
- ☐ #strong[13b. Test methods:] Whether clinical information and index
  test results were available to the assessors of the reference
  standard.
- ☐ #strong[\14. Analysis:] Methods for estimating or comparing measures
  of diagnostic accuracy.
- ☐ #strong[\15. Analysis:] How indeterminate index test or reference
  standard results were handled.
- ☐ #strong[\16. Analysis:] How missing data on the index test and
  reference standard were handled.
- ☐ #strong[\17. Analysis:] Any analyses of variability in diagnostic
  accuracy, distinguishing prespecified from exploratory.
- ☐ #strong[\18. Analysis:] Sample size calculation.

== Results
<results>
- ☐ #strong[\19. Participants:] Flow of participants, using a diagram.
- ☐ #strong[\20. Participants:] Baseline demographic and clinical
  characteristics of participants.
- ☐ #strong[\21. Participants:] Distribution of severity of disease in
  those with the target condition; other diagnoses in participants
  without the target condition.
- ☐ #strong[\22. Test results:] Time interval from index test to
  reference standard, and any treatment administered between them.
- ☐ #strong[\23. Test results:] Cross tabulation of the index test
  results (or their distribution) by the results of the reference
  standard; for continuous results, the distribution of the test results
  by the results of the reference standard.
- ☐ #strong[\24. Test results:] Any adverse events from performing the
  index test or the reference standard.
- ☐ #strong[\25. Estimates:] Estimates of diagnostic accuracy and their
  precision (such as 95% confidence intervals).
- ☐ #strong[\26. Estimates:] Any analyses of variability, including
  subgroup analyses.
- ☐ #strong[\27. Estimates:] The number of indeterminate test results or
  missing data and where they occurred.

== Discussion
<discussion>
- ☐ #strong[\28. Study limitations:] Study limitations, including
  sources of potential bias, statistical uncertainty, and
  generalisability.
- ☐ #strong[\29. Implications for practice:] Implications for practice,
  including the intended use and clinical role of the index test.

== Other Information
<other-information>
- ☐ #strong[\30. Registration number and name of registry:] Registration
  number and name of registry.
- ☐ #strong[\31. Where the full study protocol can be accessed:] Where
  the full study protocol can be accessed.
- ☐ #strong[\32. Funding:] Sources of funding and other support; role of
  funders.
