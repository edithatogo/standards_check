Scope: The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for
Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Statement was developed to
improve the quality of reporting in studies that develop, validate, or
update prediction models.

== Instructions
<instructions>
- Use task list items for checklist boxes; these become interactive
  checkboxes in PDF.
- Use a span with class `.textfield` for free‑text fields.

== Title and Abstract
<title-and-abstract>
- ☐ #strong[\1. Title:] Identify the study as one that develops,
  validates, or updates a multivariable prediction model, specify the
  target population, and the outcome to be predicted.
- ☐ #strong[\2. Abstract:] Provide a summary of the objectives, study
  design, setting, participants, sample size, predictors, outcome,
  statistical analysis, results, and conclusions.

== Introduction
<introduction>
- ☐ #strong[\3. Background and Objectives:] Explain the medical context
  and rationale for the study, including references to existing models.

== Methods
<methods>
- ☐ #strong[\4. Source of data:] Describe the study design and key
  elements of the study setting.
- ☐ #strong[\5. Participants:] Describe the eligibility criteria for
  participants.
- ☐ #strong[\6. Outcome:] Clearly define the outcome that is predicted
  by the model, including how and when it was assessed.
- ☐ #strong[\7. Predictors:] Clearly define all predictors used in the
  model, including how and when they were measured.
- ☐ #strong[\8. Sample size:] Explain how the study size was determined.
- ☐ #strong[\9. Missing data:] Describe how missing data were handled.
- ☐ #strong[\10. Statistical analysis methods:] Describe how predictors
  were handled in the analyses.
- ☐ #strong[\11. Model development:] Specify the type of model, all
  model-building procedures, and the method for internal validation.
- ☐ #strong[\12. Model performance:] Specify all measures used to assess
  model performance and, if relevant, to compare multiple models.

== Results
<results>
- ☐ #strong[\13. Participants:] Describe the flow of participants
  through the study.
- ☐ #strong[\14. Model development:] Specify the number of participants
  and outcome events in each analysis.
- ☐ #strong[\15. Model specification:] Present the full prediction model
  for use by others.
- ☐ #strong[\16. Model performance:] Report performance measures for the
  prediction model.
- ☐ #strong[\17. Model validation:] For validation, describe how the
  predictions were calculated and report the results.

== Discussion
<discussion>
- ☐ #strong[\18. Limitations:] Discuss any limitations of the study.
- ☐ #strong[\19. Interpretation:] Give an overall interpretation of the
  results, considering objectives, limitations, and other relevant
  evidence.
- ☐ #strong[\20. Implications:] Discuss the implications for practice
  and research.

== Other Information
<other-information>
- ☐ #strong[\21. Supplementary information:] Provide information about
  the availability of supplementary resources.
